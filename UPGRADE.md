# Upgrade

## 0.26.0

### Overlay skins

The overlays have been fixed to match the grid system. Therefore the `wide`
skin was replaced by a `small`, `medium` and `large` skin. The old one was
removed, because all the widths were changed and overlays have to be
reconsidered anyway.

### Lock and Unlocking the dropzone overlay

The behaviour of the overlay in the dropzone got slightly changed.
The changes introduced, forces the overlay to either be a popup
or a "normal" dropzone directly rendered into the dom. This changes
made locking and unlocking the dropzone popup obsolete.

### Dropzone canceling upload when overlay closes

The component option `cancelUploadOnOverlayClick` got renamed to
`cancelUploadOnOverlayClose`.

## 0.24.0

### DataNavigation locale

When the data navigation initializes it waits for a locale, which
can be either passed via its options or with an event. The name
of the introduced option is `locale`, the event is called
`husky.data-navigation.set-locale`.

### Thumbnail view in datagrid

The thumbnail view in the datagrid got removed and is not supported
anymore.

## 0.17.0

### DataNavigation events

The data navigation events `husky.data-navigation.select` have been renamed to
`husky.data-navigation.selected`, because they are emitted after an element has
been selected.

## 0.16.0

### Infinite scroll
The infinite-scroll-extension got refactored. To initialize infinite-scroll on an element, use
"this.sandbox.infiniteScroll.initialize(selector, callback)" instead of "this.sandbox.infiniteScroll(selector, callback)" now.
